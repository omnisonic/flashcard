* under developement.  A memory aid project.
Flashcard application  using python.
Cards are devided into different decks depending on their learned status by  the user.  One deck has all the cards.  Another deck is of the current working set of cards.  The third deck is the cards that the user has sufficiently studied for their current session.

The strategy is to start with two cards and add cards incrementally to the current study deck.

In this way the memorization starts easily and your memory builds upon and references what it already knows in order to remember more.

Once a card feels easy to recall , the user move it into the third "archive deck.
